### Project:
  ```
  name: Linux Server Hardening â€“ Network Traffic Capture & Analysis
```
  ```
author: "Harish Babu G"
```
### Overview: >
```    This project demonstrates Linux server hardening by securing SSH, configuring
    firewall rules, and protecting against brute-force attacks. Additionally, live
    network traffic was captured and analyzed to ensure no credentials were exposed.
```
### Objective:
  ```- Capture and analyze live SSH network traffic.
  - Implement hardening measures:
      - Disable root login
      - Enforce key-based authentication
      - Configure UFW firewall
      - Install and configure Fail2ban
```
### Tools_used:
 ``` - Ubuntu (Docker container)
  - Kali Linux
  - OpenSSH Server
  - UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)
  - Fail2ban
  - tcpdump & Wireshark
```
### Deliverables:
```  - Before/After summary of server hardening
  - Applied commands list
  - Network traffic capture (pcap)
  - Screenshots (see screenshots folder)
```
